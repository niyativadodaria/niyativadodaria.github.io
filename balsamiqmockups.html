        <p class="p">I have designed Simple, Elegent and Easy to fill data entry form for my Fiverr client.</p>

        <p class="p">These forms are much complex and scatterd in 6 A4 size Pages. I understood the requiremnt and web developemnt platform for the client, that is Bootstrap. I used comman and enhanced control for Bootstrap and made this Single page theme for the Form in Balsamiq mock-up designing software.</p>
        
        <p class="p">Same forms are also replicated in Mobile view. I have followed Google SDK guidlines for designing the controls and layout for the form. I have also take a look at Apple Human Interface design for interacting with Apple devices.</p>
        <p class="p">The overall expirianced was amazing. I have completed these work in 4 Days and charged some buks for Extra fast delivery for the same.
