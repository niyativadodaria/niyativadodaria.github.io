        <h3 class="h3">A tap that clean itself, reduce water, easy to wash your dirty hands</h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="p">It is based on the principle as escaping reusing and eliminates the cycle of cleaning and recleaning hands.</p>
        
        <p class="p">Suppose, accidently Inkpot you were using droped some ink on your hand. Now what will you do?
        </p>
        <p class="p">Right, You got to washroom and turn ON the tap. When you turn ON the tap. Bit amount of ink stick on Tap it self. But you might have not noticed that. But its ok. So now you have washed your hand. You are about to close the TAP. But wait, Tap is yet inked! When you have opened the tap, Some amount of INK is stick on it. Now when you OFF the TAP, that INK is stick on your cleaned hand at a same time. Problem! Right!

          <p class="p">Design of the Tap - Futurified
        </p>
        <p class="p">With aiming that, When you first time turn ON the TAP, it clean itself. So when you turn it OFF. The tap is clean same as your hands.
        </p>
        <p class="p">As explained in this sketch, Design of the tap is such that it cleans it self, It is not dependant on the user to do that. This will make less of water uses. And more friendly desiged TAP of future.
